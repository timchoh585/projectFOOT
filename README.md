# projectFOOT
Human Augmentics Project - Foot Augmentation for propulsion phase of the gait

This code allows an Android device to select a bluetooth device
in our case, we are connecting our Android to HC-05 Arduino BT Module

We then show a heat map based on sent data from the Arduino to Android

to get the application:
1) go into directory \projectFOOT_android
2) move app-debug.apk into your download directory on your device
3) install application
4) go into bluetooth settings in your device and connect to the HC-05 Module
5) run application and select the correct bluetooth module
